Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm
Overview
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm used to traverse or search through graphs and trees. Starting from a source node, BFS explores all its 
neighboring nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This traversal method is particularly useful for finding 
the shortest path in unweighted graphs, as it guarantees that the shortest path to each node is found first.

BFS Algorithm Steps
Initialization:

Visited List: Keeps track of whether a node has been visited or not.
Parent List: Records the parent of each node in the traversal path.
Distance List: Stores the distance of each node from the source node.
Queue: A data structure to manage the nodes to be explored, following the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
Starting the Search:

Set the source node as visited and initialize its distance to 0.
Enqueue the source node into the queue.
Processing Nodes:

While the queue is not empty:
Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
For each neighbor of this node:
If the neighbor has not been visited:
Mark it as visited.
Set its parent to the current node.
Update its distance.
Enqueue the neighbor.
Completion:

After processing all reachable nodes, return the results: lists of visited nodes, distances from the source, and parent nodes.


Multisource Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm
Overview
Multisource Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an extension of the BFS algorithm designed to handle multiple source nodes simultaneously. Instead of starting 
the traversal from a single source, Multisource BFS begins from all given source nodes at the same time. This approach is particularly useful when you 
want to find the shortest distance from any of several sources to all other nodes in the graph.

Multisource BFS Algorithm Steps
Initialization:

Visited List: Keeps track of whether a node has been visited. Nodes are marked as visited when they are first encountered.
Parent List: Records the parent of each node in the traversal path.
Distance List: Stores the shortest distance from any source node to each node.
Queue: A data structure used to manage the nodes to be explored, following the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
Starting the Search:

Set all source nodes as visited and initialize their distances to 0.
Enqueue all source nodes into the queue.
Processing Nodes:

While the queue is not empty:
Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
For each neighbor of this node:
If the neighbor has not been visited:
Mark it as visited.
Set its parent to the current node.
Update its distance.
Enqueue the neighbor.
Completion:

After processing all reachable nodes from all sources, return the results: lists of visited nodes, distances from the nearest source, and parent nodes¬∏.

Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental graph traversal technique that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This method 
is particularly useful for tasks such as pathfinding, cycle detection, and topological sorting.

Overview
The DFS algorithm traverses a graph or a tree structure by moving down to the deepest nodes before backtracking. This implementation assumes the graph 
is represented as an adjacency list, where each node has a list of its adjacent nodes.

Function Description
The DFS function performs a depth-first traversal of a graph starting from a given source node. The function takes two parameters:

source: The starting node for the DFS traversal. This is an integer representing the index of the source node in the adjacency list.
adjacencyList: A list of lists representing the graph. Each sublist contains the indices of adjacent nodes for a given node.
Output
The function returns a dictionary with the following keys:

visited: A list indicating the visitation status of each node. A value of 1 means the node has been visited, while -1 means it has not been visited.
parent: A list where each entry at index i contains the parent node of node i during the DFS traversal. The parent of the source node is set to -1.
pre: A list where each entry at index i contains the pre-order timestamp of node i. This timestamp is assigned when the node is first visited.
post: A list where each entry at index i contains the post-order timestamp of node i. This timestamp is assigned when the node has finished exploring 
all its adjacent nodes.
Detailed Explanation
Initialization:

The number of nodes n is determined from the length of the adjacency list.
Four lists are initialized:
visited to keep track of whether each node has been visited.
parent to record the parent of each node in the DFS tree.
pre to store the pre-order timestamps of nodes.
post to store the post-order timestamps of nodes.
A counter count is used to generate the timestamps for pre-order and post-order visits.
DFS Traversal:

The traversal starts with the given source node. The node is marked as visited, and its pre-order timestamp is recorded.
The algorithm then recursively visits all adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet, updating their parent information.
After all adjacent nodes are explored, the node‚Äôs post-order timestamp is recorded.
The traversal continues until all reachable nodes have been explored.
Returning Results:

After completing the DFS traversal, the function returns a dictionary containing the visited, parent, pre, and post lists.
Use Cases
Pathfinding: DFS can be used to find a path between nodes in a graph.
Cycle Detection: DFS helps in detecting cycles in a graph by tracking the visitation status and parent nodes.
Topological Sorting: In directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), DFS is used for topological sorting of nodes.
Example
Given an adjacency list representing a graph, the DFS function performs a depth-first traversal starting from a specified source node and provides 
detailed traversal information.

Notes
The graph is assumed to be undirected. For directed graphs, the adjacency list should reflect the direction of edges.
The algorithm handles cyclic graphs and will correctly visit all nodes reachable from the source node.
This DFS implementation provides a comprehensive view of the traversal process and is useful for various graph-related tasks and algorithms.



Topological Sort Algorithm
Overview
Topological sorting is a fundamental algorithm used to order the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) linearly. This ordering ensures that for every directed edge 
ùë¢
‚Üí
ùë£
u‚Üív, vertex 
ùë¢
u appears before vertex 
ùë£
v in the sequence. This is particularly useful in scenarios where certain tasks must be performed before others due to dependencies.

Intuition Behind Topological Sort
Imagine you are managing a project with several tasks, and some tasks can only be started after others are completed. For example, you cannot start painting a wall until it has been built. In such 
cases, topological sorting helps you determine a valid sequence to execute all tasks. By identifying tasks with no dependencies and processing them first, you ensure that the order respects all 
dependencies.

Algorithm Explanation
In-Degree Calculation:

The algorithm starts by calculating the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex in the graph. Vertices with an in-degree of 0 have no dependencies and can be processed immediately.
Queue Initialization:

A queue is initialized with all vertices that have an in-degree of 0. These vertices are independent and can be considered the starting point.
Processing Vertices:

The algorithm then iteratively removes vertices from the queue, adds them to the topological order, and decreases the in-degree of their adjacent vertices. If an adjacent vertex‚Äôs in-degree becomes 
0, it is added to the queue, indicating that all its dependencies have been resolved.
Cycle Detection:

If the queue is exhausted before all vertices are processed, the graph contains a cycle, and a topological sort is not possible. In this case, the algorithm returns an indication that the graph is 
cyclic.
Output:

If all vertices are processed, the algorithm returns the vertices in topologically sorted order, ensuring that all dependencies are respected.
Explanation of Implementation
The implementation leverages the concepts of in-degree calculation and queue processing to achieve topological sorting:

In-Degree Calculation: Each vertex's dependencies are counted by traversing the adjacency list of the graph.
Queue Processing: Vertices with no dependencies are processed first, and as their adjacent vertices' in-degrees decrease, new vertices are added to the queue for processing.
Cycle Detection: If there are vertices left unprocessed after the queue is empty, it indicates a cycle in the graph, making a topological sort impossible.
The process is efficient, typically running in linear time relative to the number of vertices and edges,

O(V+E), making it suitable for large graphs.

Use Cases
Task Scheduling: In project management, tasks often have dependencies. Topological sorting helps determine the sequence in which tasks should be executed to respect these dependencies.

Course Prerequisites: In academic planning, some courses require the completion of others before they can be taken. Topological sorting can be used to find a feasible order to complete the courses.

Build Systems: In software development, building a project may require compiling components in a specific order due to dependencies. Topological sorting ensures that each component is built after 
its dependencies.

Dependency Resolution: In package managers or data serialization, topological sorting can be used to resolve dependencies in the correct order, ensuring that all prerequisites are handled before 
their dependents.

Conclusion
Topological sorting is an essential algorithm for scenarios where dependency management is critical. It provides a systematic way to order tasks, courses, or components, ensuring that all 
dependencies are satisfied before proceeding. Whether managing projects, planning academic courses, or building software, topological sorting is a versatile tool for ensuring that tasks are executed 
in the correct sequence.
